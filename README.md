# Travelling-Salesman-Problem

# What is TSP?
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the challenge
of finding the shortest yet most efficient route for a
person to take given a list of specific destinations. It is
a well-known algorithmic problem in the fields of
computer science and operations research.
# What is Genetic Algorithm?
The process of natural selection starts with the selection of fittest
individuals from a population. They produce offspring which inherit
the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next
generation. If parents have better fitness, their offspring will be
better than parents and have a better chance at surviving. This
process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the
fittest individuals will be found.
# Methods used
  1. Initial population
  2. Fitness function
  3. Selection
  4. Crossover
